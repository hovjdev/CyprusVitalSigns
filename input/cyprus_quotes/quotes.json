Rather than seriously trying to cut our CO2 emissions, we've seen the embrace of offsetting (paying a poor person to diet for us, to allow us to carry on with our high-carbon lifestyle); the Clean Development Mechanism (state-sanctioned offsetting); afforestation schemes (plant a tree, build an airport); as well as speculative negative emission technologies and geoengineering. Offsetting, which is particularly prevalent in academia and in international climate meetings, is worse than doing nothing. Its existence and the problems associated with offsets manifest how we've failed at every level.",

Particularly in the current political climate, audiences want to be told that everything will be all right in the end. And, unfortunately, I have a deep-seated need to be liked and a natural tendency to optimism that leads me to accept more speaking invitations than is good for me. Climate change is bleak, the organizers always say. Tell us a happy story. Give us hope. The problem is, I don't have any.",
